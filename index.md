Week 1 Lab Report
__Installing Visual Studio Code__
> I had already installed VSC for my cse 12 class so I did not need install anything during this step. I created a new file for this class on my computer and connected it to my github page.

__Remotely Connecting__ 
> First I connected my VSC to bash so i could use ssh to connect to a lab computer from the terminal. Then I tried to logged into cs15lwi23ahe@ieng6.ucsd.edu but was unable to because my password was not working. To try and fix it I repeatedly tried to reset my password. I sucessfully reset my password but was still unlable to proceed.
